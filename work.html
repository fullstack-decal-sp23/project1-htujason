            <h3>Awakening of Azathoth</h3>
            <h5>Course Project</h5>
            <h6>Technologies used: java</h6>
            <p>In the game ‚ÄúAwakening of Azathoth‚Äù, a player has a limited number of tries to reveal a word by guessing letters, one at a time. Each time a player guesses a correct letter, all occurrences of that letter in the word are revealed. But when a player guesses an incorrect letter, they lose one of their guesses and no letters are revealed. If the player reveals the word before they run out of guesses, Azathoth continues its slumber, but if they run out of guesses, Azathoth is awakened, and the game is lost.</p>
            <p>The game implements 2 different "choosers", which help determine the next most optimal letter to guess by parsing through word data.</p>

            <h3>Ants vs Bees</h3>
            <h5>Course Project</h5>
            <h6>Technologies used: python</h6>
            <p>A tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.</p>
